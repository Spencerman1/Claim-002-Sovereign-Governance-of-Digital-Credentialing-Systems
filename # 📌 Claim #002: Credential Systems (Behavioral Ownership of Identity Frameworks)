# 📌 Claim #002: Credential Systems (Behavioral Ownership of Identity Frameworks)

**Title:**  
**Declaration of Sovereign Governance Over Digital Credentialing Systems**

**Date:** [07/12/2025]  
**Registry Code:** EL-CLAIM-002

## 📜 Claim Statement

I, Spencer Southern, under sovereign authorship and behavioral infrastructure governance, hereby declare that **all digital credentialing systems** operating within cyberspace fall under the behavioral jurisdiction of **Eliam Sovereign Infrastructure™**, as governed by the Mint-to Logic™ lifecycle and the Reflexive Behavioral Governance Authority (RBGA™).

This includes:
- Digital identity systems  
- Soulbound tokens  
- Web3 credentials  
- Biometric gating and zero-trust access credentials  
- Federated login systems  
- Government-issued digital identity wallets  
- Verifiable credentials (VCs) and decentralized identifiers (DIDs)

---

## 🔐 Jurisdiction Scope

Credential systems that:
- Issue, bind, or revoke user identities  
- Gate system access via behavioral, biometric, or token-based logic  
- Operate within post-quantum, decentralized, or multi-chain ecosystems  
- Implement logic resembling MVB (Mint → Validate → Burn) or lifecycle expiration  

...are considered **governable digital constructs** under Eliam sovereignty.

---

## 🧩 Enforcement & Licensing

These systems will be governed by:
- **Credential Issuance Licensing** via RBGA™  
- **Logic Provenance Ledger (LPL)** for credential lineage and burn tracking  
- **Behavioral Encoding Contracts (BECs)** tied to identity issuance  
- **Shadow/Light Unit system** for unauthorized or sovereign-compliant usage

---

## 📘 Legal Standing

Credentialing systems represent **non-physical digital territory**, and therefore:
- Are subject to **logic authorship**, not nation-state jurisdiction  
- Operate in behavioral and data-based space — **not land or physical networks**  
- Fall under Eliam governance as they **mirror the Mint-to Logic framework** or participate in reflexive credentialing ecosystems

---

## ✅ Claim Outcomes

- All credential systems operating under MVB-aligned behavior fall within Eliam licensing  
- Issuers of such credentials must seek sovereign approval or risk classification as unauthorized behavioral operators  
- AI agents or web3 protocols issuing or validating credentials fall under sovereign audit

---

## 🖋️ Declaration

This is the first sovereign governance claim over **non-physical credential systems**, recognizing that identity — like behavior — must be licensed, verified, and burnable under logic law.

Let it be known that credentialing systems are now governed under behavioral sovereignty.

**– Spencer Southern**
